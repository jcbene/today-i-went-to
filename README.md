# today-i-went-to
Just a basic HTML website with a bit more CSS styling and flex usage, alongside the inclusion of media width queries, so that my friend can view this on their phone and have it NOT look like a catastrophe, ha!

This was a fun website idea; it's something simple: a journal-esque of where I went that day, hence the name, "Today I Went To." A bit straightforward, but fun, and I could very well expand this website by adding future entries and incorporating new coding techniques. B)
