# today-i-went-to
Just a html website with a bit more css styling and flex-usage, alongside an inclusion of media width queries so that my friend can view this on their phone and have it NOT look like a catasrophy, ha!

This was a fun website idea; It's something simple: a journal-esque of where I went to that day, hence the name, "Today I Went To." A bit straightforward but fun, and I think I could easily expand this website when I add future entries and coding techniques. B)
